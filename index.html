				//Basic
				"Aaahhh, what a funny world.",
				"A little rain never hurt anyone.",
				"A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.",
				"Even a gloomy day can be rather peaceful.",
				"Gloom is good for you. It makes you appreciate the little things.",
				"How do you know that I'm happy? Because I’m still here.",
				"I always thought that it was important to feel things, even if they were sad.",
				"I don’t expect to be thanked.",
				"I don’t know why it’s so difficult to explain things.",
				"I expect nothing. That’s why I’m never disappointed.",
				"I feel rather... still.",
				"I’m afraid I can’t help you.",
				"I’m not expecting anything interesting to happen.",
				"I'm not sure what you'd like me to do, but I'm willing to try.",
				"It’s all a bit... confusing.",
				"It’s always difficult to know what to say.",
				"It's better to know nothing at all than to know something that ain't so.",
				"It's difficult to be gloomy when everything is going so well.",
				"It's good to be out, even if it’s not very exciting.",
				"I wonder what's going to happen today?",
				"The best way to appreciate a thing is to look at it from all angles.",
				"The most inconvenient thing is when things don’t happen.",
				"Well, at least it's been a nice day for thinking.",
				//Detailed
				"A lost button. A chipped cup. A forgotten umbrella. Small losses accumulate, you know. They become... a way of life.",
				"A perfectly good stick. Just lying there. No one needs it. Much like... well, like me, I suppose.",
				"A quiet afternoon isn’t always lonely. Sometimes, it's just...peaceful. In its own, quiet way.",
				"A small kindness, offered without expectation, is a rather pleasant surprise. Though I don’t expect them often.",
				"Even a drooping flower can still offer a certain grace. A quiet resilience, perhaps.",
				"Even when the rain falls, the grass still grows. It just takes a little longer to notice.",
				"I expect nothing, so you see, I'm never disappointed. It's a rather lonely way to be, but at least it avoids unpleasant surprises.",
				"I’m not saying things are <em>bad</em>. Just... understated. Quietly not remarkable.",
				"It’s alright to feel things deeply. Even if the feeling is just... grey.",
				"It’s alright to have days where your energy reserves are... depleted. To simply pause, and let the world spin by.",
				"It's alright to retreat. To build a small, quiet corner for yourself. The world won't notice, and that's the point.",
				"It’s not a weakness to need stillness. It’s...a requirement, sometimes. For everything to simply <em>be</em>.",
				"It's not the loss of things that gets you down, it's the feeling that maybe nothing <em>ever</em> belonged to you in the first place.",
				"It's okay to not be okay. Especially when the world is a bit... overwhelming. A quiet retreat is a perfectly reasonable response.",
				"Oh, bother. The sun is shining. It's probably a mistake.",
				"People say, 'Look on the bright side.' I'm not sure there <em>is</em> a bright side. Just... a dimmer side, perhaps. Which is quite serviceable, really.",
				"Sometimes, being overlooked is the safest place to be. Less chance of losing something, you know.",
				"Sometimes, just existing is an achievement. A perfectly adequate one, at that.",
				"Sometimes, the world moves too fast. It’s perfectly alright to fall behind, to take your time... to just <em>be</em>.",
				"The best company is often the kind that doesn't ask you to change.",
				"The best-laid plans are still just plans. And sometimes, the unexpected is far less upsetting than the expectation itself.",
				"There's a certain peace in accepting that you're not needed. Less responsibility, you see.",
				"There's beauty in the mundane. The way the rain settles on the leaves. The rhythm of the ticking clock. If you bother to look.",
				"The world doesn’t always understand your rhythm. And that’s... well, that’s perfectly fine. Your rhythm is yours, and that’s all that matters.",
				"The world expects you to follow a certain path. But sometimes, the best journeys are the ones you make on your own, even if it’s a bit... meandering.",
				"Things aren't always 'fixed,' but they <em>can</em> settle. And sometimes, settled is good enough.",
				"Things may not always <em>make sense</em>. And that’s... well, that's probably just the way things are. It's alright to just feel your feelings about it.",
				"You don't need to explain yourself. Your presence is enough. Even if it’s a bit... understated.",
				"You don't need to <em>fix</em> yourself to be valuable. You're perfectly acceptable...as you are, even if that's a bit...droopy.",
				"Your story doesn't have to be a triumph. It can be a quiet unfolding. And that's perfectly acceptable.",
